# Ask-My-PDF üß†üìÑ

Ask-My-PDF is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload a PDF and interact with its contents through natural language questions. It uses **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **OpenAI/LLMs** to extract, embed, and retrieve information in real time.

## üìÇ File Structure

```bash
ask-my-pdf/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                  # Streamlit UI and core logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore              # To ignore venv and unnecessary files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                    # Store your API keys securely

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gurmehak-2000/ask-my-pdf.git
cd ask-my-pdf
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # or source venv/bin/activate for Mac/Linux
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 5. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üß† How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. **PDF Loader** extracts content using LangChain.
2. **Text Splitter** breaks content into manageable chunks.
3. **Embeddings** are created using OpenAI (or other LLMs).
4. **ChromaDB** stores and indexes embeddings.
5. **LLM** answers user queries based on retrieved document chunks.

## üí° Use Cases

* Academic research
* Document summarization
* Legal/medical document querying
* Quick insight extraction from large PDFs

---

## üöß Known Limitations

* Heavy dependencies (Torch) may cause GitHub push issues
* Works best with text-based PDFs (not scanned images)
